"Avengers, assemble!" - Pretty much everyone 



(but mostly Captain America)



"The teamâ€™s lineup changed almost immediately, with the departure of the Hulk and the induction of Captain America, who had been frozen in a block of ice since the end of the World War II." 

-- Britannica 


Huh I wonder what it would it be like to be frozen in a block of ice and then suddenly wake up to be in another century

That would be pretty freaky
